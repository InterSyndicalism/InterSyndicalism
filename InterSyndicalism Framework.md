A proposal for a decentralized, democratic meritocracy of syndicates operating as a federation.
# Introduction
Workers of the world, of any background or identity unite for the cause of change. To make the world just. To take power and resources from those who hoard it. To win the world that belongs to us. We do this in the faith of a better future, of a united world and of peace. Our investment in the good work of humanity in our hearts and minds becomes real and exacting in measure through this framework.Â 

Thanks to history, it is recognized that ambiguity and permanence only harm our posterity. As a result this framework is designed to be adaptable, revisable, extensible and clear. Submission of flaws or refinements to public knowledge is welcomed as all will only serve to improve this framework over time.
