The first if, hopefully, many reports on the progress of InterSyndicalism. This first document is more accurately described as an introduction to InterSyndicalism for all.
## Introduction
World powers ebb and flow like the fluid entities they overlay, even with state publicities supposedly showing all manner of strength. People’s lives are changed by these powers as they pretend to be singular entities. In reality, as you may already hold, these nations are merely labels for large groups of people, nothing more. This document does not seek to personify the manner to which this division has come about, because as it will be clear later, these personifications do more harm than good for society. 

This document instead focuses in a careful, considered way as to how to approach the problems of the present day. These problems manifest as the result of centuries of inequality-driven growth that has a benefit to some more than others. This document is, admittedly, quite leftist - but is rendered, without one-dimensional labels, from the position of workers, instead of a supposed better system for the masses told by an aspiring group of dictators who seek only to redefine the “one percent” to include themselves. 

This framework is a scientific exercise exploring the possibility of combining the stability of the decentralized nature of a federation, as a model of government, with the economic security and freedom provided by syndicates. It is designed to be a flexible, gradual movement away from establishment-controlled centrally governed nations to a federated, local worker controlled government. This system is designed with the long standing earmarks of public ownership and maximized welfare et cetera that are indicative of a left system, while being presented in a new and progressive manner to appeal to a non-political population. Proper execution of the recommended strategies of this framework could completely reform the current systems with minimum disruption to everyday life.

For the purposes of clarity, let us completely describe the current problems of our world, allowing us to circle back around once this framework has been set out to discuss how said problems are solved by this system. After discussing the framework and the problems it solves, we will then “stress test” this system by exploring real world issues and how they can be overcome.

Additionally, it should be noted this is not a definition of the Federated Syndicalism system, this document is a companion document, commenting on the framework and discussing it. This can be seen as the more “user friendly” piece, while the other is more like a legal document.
# Part 1 - Current Problems
It is well known by progressives of the 21st century that, despite the allied victory in 1945, fascism is still ever present. Fascism, while a personified concept defining World War Two and the years afterward, should not be characterized as a new concept, even if its name is such. 

Fascism has
